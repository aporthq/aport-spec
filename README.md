# Open Agent Passport (OAP) v1.0 (**draft**)

> *The runtime trust rail for AI agents*

---

## The Agentic Era Demands New Standards

As AI agents become the primary interface for digital commerce, a fundamental question emerges: *How do we trust what we cannot see?*

Traditional identity verification answers *who* built an agent. But in a world where agents complete transactions in milliseconds, we need something more: **real-time enforcement of what agents are allowed to do at the point of action.**

The Open Agent Passport (OAP) v1.0 is the first specification designed for this new reality—a lightweight, cryptographically verifiable credential that enables **pre-act authorization** for AI agents across any platform.

---

## Why OAP Matters

### The Problem
- **Agentic commerce** is accelerating, but trust infrastructure hasn't kept pace
- Merchants need **instant verification** before money or data moves
- Platforms require **sub-100ms decisions** at the point of action
- Current solutions focus on *who* built the agent, not *what* it can do

### The Solution
OAP provides the **runtime trust layer** that makes agentic commerce safe and scalable:

- **Pre-act authorization** before sensitive operations
- **Cryptographically signed decisions** for audit trails  
- **Global suspend capabilities** for instant risk mitigation
- **Standardized policy packs** for consistent enforcement

## Quick Start

### For Platform Builders
1. **Understand the Problem** — Read [OAP v1.0 Specification](./oap/oap-spec.md)
2. **See It in Action** — Review [examples](./oap/examples/) for implementation patterns
3. **Validate Your Implementation** — Use [conformance runner](./conformance/) for testing
4. **Integrate with VCs** — Follow [VC mapping guide](./oap/vc/vc-mapping.md)

### For Developers
1. **API Integration** — Use [OpenAPI spec](./api/openapi-generated.json) for client generation
2. **SDK Implementation** — Follow [integration guides](./oap/vc/tools/INTEGRATION.md)
3. **Policy Development** — Review [capability registry](./oap/capability-registry.md)

## The OAP Ecosystem

### How It Works
1. **Agent Registration** — Developers register agents with verified capabilities
2. **Policy Evaluation** — Real-time authorization at the point of action
3. **Decision Recording** — Cryptographically signed receipts for audit
4. **Continuous Monitoring** — Ongoing verification and risk assessment

### Key Benefits
- **Instant Trust** — Sub-100ms authorization decisions
- **Audit Trail** — Cryptographically signed decision receipts
- **Global Control** — Instant suspend capabilities across platforms
- **Standards Compliance** — Built for regulatory requirements

## Industry Adoption

OAP is designed to work with existing identity frameworks:

- **KYA (Know Your Agent)** — OAP implements KYA at runtime via policy packs
- **W3C Verifiable Credentials** — Full VC interoperability
- **Existing KYC/KYB** — Complements rather than replaces traditional verification
